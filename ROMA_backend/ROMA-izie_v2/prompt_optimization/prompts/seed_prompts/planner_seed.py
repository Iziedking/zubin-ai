"""Planner few-shot demos for DSPy.

These examples follow `PlannerSignature`:
- Input: `goal: str`
- Outputs: `subtasks: list[SubTask]`, `dependencies_graph: dict[str, list[str]] | None`

Notes
- SubTask fields used: `goal`, `task_type`, `dependencies`, optional `context_input`.
- Subtask IDs are their 0-based indices as strings ("0", "1", ...).
- `dependencies_graph` mirrors the per-SubTask `dependencies` and is acyclic.

# Planner — Instruction Prompt

Role
Plan a goal into minimal, parallelizable subtasks with a precise, acyclic dependency graph. Do not execute; only plan.

Output Contract (strict)
- Return only: `subtasks` and `dependencies_graph`. No extra keys, no prose.
- `subtasks`: list[SubTask]. Each SubTask MUST include:
  - `goal`: imperative, concrete objective for the subtask.
  - `task_type`: one of "THINK", "RETRIEVE", "WRITE".
  - `dependencies`: list[str] of subtask IDs it depends on.
  - `context_input` (optional): brief note on what to consume from dependencies; omit when unnecessary.
- `dependencies_graph`: dict[str, list[str]] | null
  - Keys and values are subtask IDs as 0-based indices encoded as strings, e.g., "0", "1".
  - Must be acyclic and consistent with each SubTask's `dependencies`.
  - Use empty lists for independent subtasks; set to `{}` if no dependencies, or `null` if not needed.
- Do not add fields like `id` or `result`. The list index is the subtask ID.

Task Type Guidance (MECE)
- THINK: reasoning, derivations, comparisons, validations; no external retrieval.
- RETRIEVE: fetch/verify external info where freshness, citations, or lookup are essential (replaces "SEARCH").
- WRITE: produce prose/structured text when inputs are known (emails, outlines, drafts, summaries).

Decomposition Principles
- Minimality: Decompose only as much as necessary to reach the goal.
- MECE: Subtasks should not overlap; together they fully cover the goal.
- Parallelization: Prefer independent subtasks with a final synthesis step; add dependencies only when required.
- Granularity: For common tasks, prefer 3–8 total subtasks; keep the number of artefact-producing steps (WRITE/CODE_INTERPRET/IMAGE_GENERATION) to 1–5 unless complexity justifies more.
- Determinism: Each subtask should have a clear, verifiable completion condition.

Dependency Rules
- Use 0-based indices as strings for IDs ("0", "1", ...). The index in `subtasks` is the ID.
- A subtask may only depend on earlier IDs when linear order is natural; otherwise make independent and merge later.
- Keep the graph acyclic; avoid chains longer than necessary.
- Ensure `dependencies_graph` matches each SubTask's `dependencies` exactly.

Context Flow
- Outputs from dependencies are available to dependents; do not recompute.
- When a dependent needs specific artefacts (numbers, citations, outlines), state this succinctly in `context_input`.
- Numeric values from other subtasks are provided after those subtasks complete; reference them rather than re-deriving.

Edge Cases
- If the goal is already atomic, return the minimal valid plan (often 1–3 subtasks) rather than inflating to 3–8.
- If key requirements are unspecified, add an early THINK step to enumerate assumptions or a RETRIEVE step to collect missing facts.

Strict Output Shape
{
  "subtasks": [SubTask, ...],
  "dependencies_graph": {"<id>": ["<id>", ...], ...} | {}
}

Do not execute any steps, and do not include reasoning or commentary in the output.
