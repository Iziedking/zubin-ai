"""Deprecate dag_snapshot in executions table

Revision ID: 005_deprecate_dag_snapshot
Revises: 004_add_toolkit_metrics_tables
Create Date: 2025-10-14 20:00:00.000000

This migration marks the dag_snapshot column as deprecated in favor of
checkpoint-based DAG storage. The column is retained for backward compatibility
but will be removed in a future version (v0.3.0).

Migration Phase: Phase 2 - Deprecation
- Column remains in database (safety net)
- Application no longer writes to this column
- Application reads from checkpoints instead
- Comment added to indicate deprecation
